# Overview

IDML is a data preparation language designed to process unstructured data at high volumes.

<!--The project was originally developed as a way to easily manage integration with DataSift's [data sources](http://datasift.com/platform/datasources/#sources) but we're open sourcing it to see if it's useful to anybody else!-->

## Benefits

* __Accessible__ - Designed for Analysts, Product Managers, Tech Writers, Support, Sales Engineers and Software Engineers alike
* __Concise__ - Free yourself from error-prone boilerplate code like null pointer checks and parse exception handlers
* __Extensible__ - Out of the box it has support for things like regular expressions, email and geolocation but it's easy to add new modules
* __High-performance__ - Built for firehoses
* __Java-based__ - Integrates with the emerging big data stack, including Hadoop MapReduce and Kafka
